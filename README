NMCB - A tiny audio player for the embedded in you
==================================================

NMCB is a tiny audio player library that talks directly to ALSA. It's
designed for super-embedded environments like early-boot where you do
not have daemons like PulseAudio available.

NMCB does also not use alsa-lib, which is far too complex and heavy
for such an embedded environment, and it doesn't use any of the
slimmer alsa libraries either, like salsa-lib, which are still fairly
complex. It instead talks to the kernel directly using the ASOUND
ioctls.

The example program, "tsndplay", plays a sound directly embedded in
its binary.
